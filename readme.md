> A small *compiled* **programming language** similar to *C*.

> Contact me for help, because I *will* respond. Discord: amukh1#9613

## Prerequisites

This project requires NodeJS (version 8 or later) and NPM.
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) are really easy to install.
To make sure you have them available on your machine,
try running the following command.

```sh
$ npm -v && node -v
6.4.1
v8.16.0
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Installation
<br>

**BEFORE YOU INSTALL:** please read the [prerequisites](#prerequisites)

<br>

To install and set up the library, run:

```sh
$ npm install ritchie
```

Or if you prefer using Yarn:

```sh
$ yarn add --dev ritchie
```

## Usage

august-lang takes 2 file extentions, .aug and .asm.
<br>

rcomp is the compiler.. (*R*itchie *Comp*iler) and putting in an .rit file compiles it to a .asm file.

```sh
$ rcomp ./file.rit name
```
ASM compiles to bytecode automatically on Linux (if your on Windows/OSX use an online compiler).

## Example program:
<br>

```
function _start() {
mov	edx, len  
mov	ecx, msg
println(ecx, edx)
SYS::EXIT
}

function println() {
pop edx
pop ecx
mov	ebx, 1	   
mov	eax, 4	 
int	0x80        
ret
}

SYS::DATA
msg db "Hello world!",0xa
len	equ	$ - msg
```
It accepts assembly (Working to add features so you wouldnt need to use assembly)
<br>
That last program is soon to be:

```
import Stdio
import Sys

function _start() {
mov	edx, len  
mov	ecx, msg
println(ecx, edx)
SYS::EXIT
}

SYS::DATA
msg db "Hello world!",0xa
len	equ	$ - msg
```
