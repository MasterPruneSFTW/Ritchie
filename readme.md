## Usage

august-lang takes 2 file extentions, .aug and .asm.
<br>

rcomp is the compiler.. (*R*itchie *Comp*iler) and putting in an .rit file compiles it to a .asm file.

```sh
$ rcomp ./file.rit name
```
ASM compiles to bytecode automatically on Linux (if your on Windows/OSX use an online compiler).
